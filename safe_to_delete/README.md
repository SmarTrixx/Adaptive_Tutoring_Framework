# Safe to Delete - Intermediate & Redundant Files

This folder contains files from previous development iterations that are no longer needed for the production-ready system. They have been preserved for reference but can be safely deleted.

## Contents

### Backup Files
- `BACKUP_FILES/` - Old backup files from earlier development phases

### Intermediate Documentation
- Implementation reports and summaries
- Difficulty adaptation fix documents (intermediate versions)
- Frontend fixes documentation (development iterations)
- Logging system documentation (earlier attempts)
- Integration guides (superseded by main documentation)

### Test & Verification Scripts
- `test_*.py` - Test scripts from development phases
- `verify_improvements.py` - Verification script for earlier fixes
- `DIAGNOSTIC_ANALYSIS.py` - Diagnostic script used during development

### Development Status Files
- Task completion reports
- Delivery summaries
- Implementation checklists
- Status reports and progress tracking

## Recommended Action

**These files can be safely deleted** as the system has:
- Production-ready code in `backend/` and `frontend/`
- Core documentation in `docs/`
- Comprehensive tests in `backend/tests/`

## If Keeping for Reference

Only preserve this folder if you need to:
- Review implementation history
- Reference old approaches or decisions
- Debug issues using diagnostic data

**For research submission and supervisor review, the project is clean and ready without these files.**
