Project Phases & Achievements
The project was planned in 4phases.
I started from building the basic online test system first, as I mentioned to you last time
then, i'm gradually building and adding other components like the intelligence, engagement monitoring, and reporting features.


The phases:
Phase 1: Core Learning System Completed
Registration/login page built and integrated.
Students can also take tests and answer questions
I've completed this phase.

Phase 2: Intelligent Difficulty Adjustment
Questions automatically become easier or harder based on student performance
The system can adapt in real time during a test
status: Completed as well.

Phase 3: Engagement & Emotion Monitoring
facial monitoring during tests
System detects basic emotions like confidence, neutrality, or frustration
Engagement data is recorded for analysis and for academic report references.
Status: Currently working on this but almost complete just little patches remains.


Phase 4: Reporting & Data Export
Student data can be exported as simple spreadsheets (CSV)
Full learning records can be downloaded as detailed data files (JSON)

Outcome of this phase: Test data can easily be exported for progress and performance review
Status: To be implemented.
