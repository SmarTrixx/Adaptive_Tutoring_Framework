## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### 1. Database Enhancement - COMPLETED
**Status:** ✅ DONE

**What was done:**
- Expanded question bank from 24 to **56 total questions**
- Organized across **4 subject areas**:
  - **Mathematics:** 15 questions (Algebra, Geometry)
  - **Science:** 15 questions (Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
  - **English:** 14 questions (Grammar, Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension)
  - **History:** 12 questions (Ancient, Medieval, Modern)

**Difficulty Distribution:**
