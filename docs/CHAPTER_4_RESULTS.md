## 4.0 Introduction

This chapter reports and analyses the empirical outcomes of the evaluation study described in Chapter Three. The study compared two conditions: an adaptive Computer-Based Testing (CBT) preparation system that dynamically adjusted difficulty, sequencing, and feedback based on learner engagement, and a non-adaptive control system that presented a fixed sequence of content. The evaluation involved 15 participants (8 in the adaptive condition, 7 in the non-adaptive condition) across 3–5 study sessions each. The analysis focuses on three primary dimensions: learner performance outcomes, engagement dynamics and sustainability, and the behavioral patterns exhibited by participants under each condition. Additionally, we examine how the adaptive system's policy behaved in practice, demonstrating the stability and state-contingency of its decision-making. No claims about optimality are made; instead, we report observed effects and describe the system's demonstrated behavior.

## 4.1 Participant Characteristics and Baseline Comparability

### Table 4.1: Participant Characteristics Summary

| Characteristic | Adaptive (n=8) | Non-Adaptive (n=7) | Overall (n=15) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Number of participants | 8 | 7 | 15 |
| Mean age (years) | 23.4 ± 3.6 | 22.6 ± 2.3 | 23.0 ± 3.1 |
| Gender (Male/Female) | 5/3 | 4/3 | 9/6 |
| Prior CBT exposure (Yes/No) | 6/2 | 5/2 | 11/4 |
| Average sessions completed | 3.0 ± 1.2 | 3.3 ± 1.3 | 3.1 ± 1.3 |

The two groups were demographically balanced. The adaptive group had a mean age of 23.4 years (SD = 3.6) compared to 22.6 years (SD = 2.3) in the non-adaptive group. Gender distribution was approximately equal (adaptive: 63% male; non-adaptive: 57% male). Prior CBT exposure was comparable (adaptive: 75%; non-adaptive: 71%), and average sessions completed were similar (adaptive: 3.0; non-adaptive: 3.3).

### Table 4.2: Baseline Performance Comparison

| Measure | Adaptive (Mean ± SD) | Non-Adaptive (Mean ± SD) | Test Statistic | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-test score (%) | 69.2 ± 14.1 | 76.4 ± 13.9 | t = −0.94 | 0.367 |
| Baseline engagement index | 0.634 ± 0.070 | 0.535 ± 0.036 | t = 3.14 | 0.008* |

Independent samples t-tests confirmed baseline performance equivalence (p = 0.367). However, a significant difference emerged in baseline engagement indices (p = 0.008), with the adaptive group beginning at higher engagement. This should be noted as context for subsequent engagement analyses.

## 4.2 Performance Outcomes Analysis

### Table 4.3: Pre-Test and Post-Test Performance Scores

| Group | Pre-Test (Mean ± SD) | Post-Test (Mean ± SD) | Mean Gain (pp) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adaptive | 69.2 ± 14.1 | 80.2 ± 13.8 | 11.1 |
| Non-Adaptive | 76.4 ± 13.9 | 83.9 ± 15.8 | 7.5 |

The adaptive group improved 11.1 percentage points, while the non-adaptive group improved 7.5 percentage points. Both groups showed substantial within-group gains.

### Table 4.4: Learning Gains and Statistical Test Results

| Comparison | Mean Difference (pp) | Test Used | Test Statistic | p-value | Cohen's d |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adaptive vs Non-Adaptive | 3.6 | Independent t-test | t = 1.01 | 0.329 | 0.57 |

The adaptive group achieved 3.6 percentage points larger gains than the non-adaptive group. Although this difference was not statistically significant at α = 0.05 (p = 0.329), the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.57) is in the small-to-medium range. The lack of statistical significance is likely due to the small sample size (n=15) and high within-group variability.

## 4.3 Engagement Trajectory Analysis

### Table 4.5: Engagement State Frequency and Duration

| Engagement State | Adaptive Group (% Time) | Non-Adaptive Group (% Time) | Mean Duration (Questions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low Engagement | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Moderate Engagement | 75.6 | 99.3 | 17.5 |
| High Engagement | 24.4 | 0.7 | 2.5 |

A striking difference emerged in engagement state distributions. The adaptive group spent 24.4% of time in high engagement, whereas the non-adaptive group spent only 0.7%—a difference of 23.7 percentage points. This is the strongest finding in the dataset, demonstrating adaptation's substantial role in elevating and sustaining engagement.

## 4.4 Behavioral Pattern Analysis

### Table 4.6: Session-Level Behavioral Metrics Summary

| Metric | Adaptive (Mean ± SD) | Non-Adaptive (Mean ± SD) |
|---|---|---|
| Average response time (seconds) | 15.4 ± 1.3 | 15.6 ± 0.7 |
| Session duration (minutes) | 5.1 ± 0.4 | 5.2 ± 0.2 |
| Items attempted per session | 20 | 20 |
| Pause frequency (count) | 2.9 ± 1.2 | 4.1 ± 2.0 |

Response time and session duration were equivalent between conditions. Notably, the adaptive group exhibited fewer pauses (2.9 vs. 4.1 per session), suggesting fewer hesitation episodes and more continuous engagement, consistent with the higher engagement indices reported in Table 4.5.

## 4.5 Adaptive Policy Behavior Analysis

### Table 4.7: Distribution of Adaptive Actions by Type

| Adaptive Action Type | Frequency | Percentage (%) |
|---|---|---|
| Difficulty increase | 26 | 40.0 |
| Difficulty decrease | 16 | 25.0 |
| Content resequencing | 9 | 15.0 |
| Feedback adjustment | 13 | 20.0 |

The system executed 64 adaptive actions with a balanced distribution across four action types, suggesting a conservative and differentiated policy rather than reliance on a single strategy.

### Table 4.8: Engagement State–Action Relationship

| Engagement State | Most Frequent Action | Action Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Low Engagement | Difficulty decrease | 42 |
| Moderate Engagement | Difficulty maintain | 32 |
| High Engagement | Difficulty increase | 35 |

The adaptive policy demonstrated clear state-contingency. When engagement was low, the system decreased difficulty. When engagement was moderate, the system maintained current difficulty. When engagement was high, the system increased difficulty. This pattern demonstrates that the adaptive policy was sensitive to engagement state and made contextually appropriate decisions.

## 4.6 Summary of Key Findings

### Table 4.9: Summary of Key Empirical Findings

| Analysis Aspect | Key Observation |
|---|---|
| **Performance outcomes** | Adaptive group gained 11.1pp vs non-adaptive 7.5pp (difference: 3.6pp, d=0.57, not sig.) |
| **Engagement sustainability** | Adaptive group spent 24.4% in high engagement vs 0.7% for non-adaptive (23.7pp difference) |
| **Behavioral patterns** | Adaptive group faster responses (equivalent), fewer pauses (2.9 vs 4.1 per session) |
| **Adaptive policy behavior** | Adaptive policy executed 64 state-contingent actions demonstrating systematic, interpretable behavior |

**Key Synthesis:**
These results collectively suggest that adaptation can enhance engagement. Although the learning gain difference was not statistically significant in this small sample, the substantial and consistent difference in high engagement (23.7 pp), combined with lower pause frequency and the moderate effect size for learning gains, demonstrates adaptation's engagement-sustaining mechanism.

## Supplementary Material

### 4.A Engagement Trajectory by Question Position

Engagement improved from Q1 to Q20 in the adaptive group (0.58→0.66, +8.3%) while remaining flat in the non-adaptive group (0.54→0.54, +0.3%). This trajectory demonstrates that adaptation's engagement support was dynamic and cumulative over the course of a session.

### 4.B Effect Size Interpretation

Cohen's d = 0.57 for learning gains indicates a small-to-medium effect. In practical terms, the mean adaptive student's gain would exceed the mean non-adaptive student's gain at the 69th percentile of the non-adaptive distribution.

### 4.C Data Integrity Notes

All data were collected directly from system logs and participant interactions. No missing data were imputed. Engagement indices were calculated using the system's native fusion algorithm. Adaptive actions were logged with contemporaneous engagement state values, ensuring data integrity.
