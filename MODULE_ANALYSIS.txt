OPTIONAL/DISABLED MODULES (Won't affect core system if disabled):
============================================================

Facial Integration (DISABLED - ENABLED = False):
  🔜 app/adaptation/facial_signal_integration.py - FacialSignalProcessor
     - Status: DISABLED BY DEFAULT
     - Used in: engine.py (but only if enabled)
     - Impact if removed: facial modifier in engine.py would fail (protected with try/except)
     - Recommendation: KEEP - minimal overhead when disabled

Optional Advanced Engagement Features:
  🔜 app/engagement/mastery.py - MasteryTracker
     - Status: IMPORTED in analytics routes, NOT used in core test flow
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py only
     - Impact if removed: Analytics endpoints would fail (but test system works fine)
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE if minimizing analytics features

  🔜 app/engagement/affective.py - AffectiveIndicatorAnalyzer
     - Status: IMPORTED in analytics routes, NOT used in core test flow
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py only
     - Impact if removed: Analytics endpoints would fail
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE if minimizing analytics features

  🔜 app/engagement/spaced_repetition.py - SpacedRepetitionScheduler, LearningCurveAnalyzer
     - Status: IMPORTED in analytics routes, NOT used in core test flow
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py only
     - Impact if removed: Analytics endpoints would fail
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE if minimizing analytics features

RL Agent (DISABLED - Never called in core flow):
  🔜 app/adaptation/rl_agent.py - RLAdaptiveAgent
     - Status: DISABLED - NOT called during normal operation
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py only (for analysis/reporting)
     - Impact if removed: Analytics endpoints would fail, but test system unchanged
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE

  🔜 app/adaptation/rl_policy_optimizer.py - RLPolicyOptimizer
     - Status: DISABLED - NOT called during normal operation
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py only
     - Impact if removed: Analytics endpoints would fail, but test system unchanged
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE

LIKELY UNUSED MODULES (No references found):
============================================================

  ❓ app/adaptation/difficulty_mapper.py - DifficultyMapper
     - Status: UNKNOWN - Check if used
     - Recommendation: AUDIT

  ❓ app/adaptation/irt.py - IRTModel, CATAlgorithm
     - Status: IMPORTED in analytics but check if actually called
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py imports (need to verify actual usage)
     - Recommendation: AUDIT

  ❓ app/adaptation/performance_window.py - WindowPerformanceTracker
     - Status: IMPORTED in adaptation/policy.py but policy.py is not used
     - Used in: policy.py (which is itself unused)
     - Impact if removed: No impact (policy.py is unused)
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE

  ❓ app/adaptation/policy.py - AdaptivePolicyEngine, AdaptiveDecision
     - Status: UNUSED - NOT called anywhere in the system
     - Used in: NOWHERE
     - Impact if removed: No impact on system function
     - Recommendation: ARCHIVE

  ❓ app/engagement/fusion.py - FusedEngagementState, EngagementState
     - Status: IMPORTED in policy.py (unused) but check other usage
     - Used in: policy.py (which is unused)
     - Impact if removed: May need to check
     - Recommendation: AUDIT

  ❓ app/engagement/indicators.py - EngagementIndicators
     - Status: IMPORTED in policy.py (unused) and other places
     - Recommendation: AUDIT

  ❓ app/engagement/facial_expression_api.py - FacialExpressionIntegrator
     - Status: IMPORTED in analytics/routes.py, check if actually used
     - Used in: analytics/routes.py (line 876)
     - Recommendation: KEEP if keeping analytics routes
