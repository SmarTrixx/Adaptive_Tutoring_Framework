real time adaptation.
iii.Implement the framework within a Computer Based Testing preparation system.
iv.Evaluate the framework’s ability to support sustained engagement and better performance.
Engagement based indicators
Engagement based indicators are measurable signs that show how actively and meaningfully a
learner is involved in a learning task. In most intelligent tutoring and CBT environments, they are
grouped into behavioural, cognitive, and affective categories. Each category provides different
evidence about how the student is interacting with the system.
Below is a structured and academically neutral description.
1. Behavioural Indicators
These reflect observable actions during study or testing and are often derived from interaction
logs.
Examples include:
* response time patterns
* frequency of attempts or retries
* navigation habits, such as rapid clicking or repeated switching
* duration of sustained activity on a task
* completion rates within a session
* number of hints or guidance requests
* periods of inactivity
These indicators help reveal whether the student is actively working, rushing, hesitating, or
disengaging.
12. Cognitive Indicators
These provide insight into the learner’s mental effort or processing level.
Examples include:
* accuracy trends across tasks
* changes in performance as difficulty increases
* evidence of guessing behaviour
* consistency or inconsistency in item-level responses
* time allocation that reflects depth of thinking
* working memory load inferred from task performance
* patterns suggesting mastery or confusion
These indicators are usually inferred rather than directly measured, since they relate to how the
student thinks rather than what they physically do.
3. Affective Indicators
These capture emotional states that shape engagement. They are often derived through computer
vision, keyboard/mouse interaction patterns, or physiological signals when available.
Examples include:
* facial cues indicating confusion, frustration, or concentration
* gaze stability or frequent shifts in attention
* signs of boredom or loss of interest
* emotional valence detected through facial expression analysis
* stress patterns inferred through behaviour or sensor data
Affective indicators are useful for understanding when the learner needs encouragement,
reduced difficulty, or a shift in instructional approach.
4. Multimodal Indicators
Many systems combine the three categories to form a richer picture.
Examples include:
* merging facial expressions with response time to infer frustration
* combining accuracy trends with gaze behaviour to detect cognitive overload
* using navigation patterns alongside emotional cues to interpret attention levels
Multimodal indicators provide more reliable insight than any single source.
Summary
Engagement based indicators help the system understand whether the learner is attentive,
struggling, motivated, confused, or disengaging. Once captured, these indicators guide adaptive
decisions such as adjusting difficulty, offering feedback, prompting a break, or delivering targeted
support.
21. Mapping Indicators to System Components
a. Behavioural Indicators → Interaction Logging Module
This module records item responses, timing patterns, navigation habits, and inactivity periods.
Its role is to provide continuous traces that reveal how actively the learner is working.
b. Cognitive Indicators → Performance Analysis Engine
This component processes accuracy trends, mastery progression, error patterns, and effort levels.
It translates performance data into estimates of the learner’s cognitive load and understanding.
c. Affective Indicators → Computer Vision and Affective Detection Unit
This unit applies facial analysis and gaze tracking to infer emotional states such as frustration or
confusion.
It provides real time feedback on the learner’s emotional condition.
d. Multimodal Indicators → Engagement Fusion Layer
This layer merges behavioural, cognitive, and affective data.
Its output is a unified engagement score or classification that improves reliability and reduces
uncertainty.
e. Adaptive Decision Layer → Reinforcement Learning Agent
The RL agent receives the fused engagement state and selects instructional actions such as
adjusting difficulty, providing hints, or prompting focus.
2. Mapping Indicators to Research Questions
Below is a direct alignment that strengthens the conceptual clarity of your study.
Research Question 1

3. Mapping Indicators to Data Collection Methods
a. Behavioural Indicators
Method: System log extraction
• timestamps
• clickstream data
• navigation histories
• item level performance logs
b. Cognitive Indicators
Method: Performance analytics
• accuracy scores
• difficulty progression
• mastery estimates
• error type profiling
c. Affective Indicators
Method: Computer vision and interaction cues
• webcam based facial expression analysis
• gaze tracking
• changes in posture or head movement
• reduced interaction speed as an inferred emotional signal
d. Multimodal Indicators
Method: Data fusion pipeline
• combines log data, performance metrics, and affective cues
• produces a final engagement classification or score
These methods ensure that the system collects the required data in a structured and fine grained
manner.
4. Mapping Indicators to Reinforcement Learning State Representations
In your adaptive tutoring framework, the RL agent needs a compact but expressive representation
of the learner’s engagement state.
4Proposed RL State Variables
Behavioural Components
• response time deviation from expected range
• number of hints requested
• inactivity duration
• task switching frequency
Cognitive Components
• current accuracy level
• slope of performance improvement or decline
• inferred cognitive load
• mastery index for current topic
Affective Components
• probability of frustration
• probability of confusion
• probability of boredom
• gaze stability score
Why this matters
A well constructed RL state allows the agent to:
• detect whether the learner is progressing or struggling
• recognise emotional shifts that require supportive intervention
• select the most suitable instructional action from the available options
The decision results in actions such as:
• increasing or reducing difficulty
• delivering a hint or explanation
• providing a motivational prompt
• suggesting a short break
• switching to a different question type
5SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
System Architecture Diagram
Explanation of the System Architecture
The architecture outlines how an adaptive, AI driven tutoring system continuously observes,
interprets, and responds to learner engagement. It follows a layered progression that moves from
raw interaction to structured adaptation. Each layer performs a distinct role, yet the entire system
functions as an integrated whole.
1. Student Interaction with the CBT Environment
Every process begins with the learner’s ordinary engagement with the CBT platform. During
practice or test preparation, the student attempts questions, navigates through the interface,
reflects on feedback, and deals with the natural fluctuations in motivation and understanding. This
6interaction is the central point around which the entire architecture operates. The system does not
impose behaviour; instead, it observes whatever the learner naturally displays during the learning
session. The reliability of the system therefore depends on capturing these interactions as
faithfully as possible.
2. Data Capture Layer
The architecture separates the learner’s observable signals into three distinct categories. This
separation ensures clarity in the type of information collected and allows different analytical
techniques to be applied.
a. Behavioural Capture
Interaction logs represent the most direct trail of learner activity. They show where effort is being
placed, how quickly tasks are being approached, and whether the learner is focused or shifting
attention irregularly. For example, a sudden rise in guessing behaviour or long pauses between
clicks may indicate emerging disengagement. These logs allow the system to recognise such
patterns without requiring learner self-reports.
b. Cognitive Capture
Performance data reflects how well the learner is processing information. As students attempt
questions of varying difficulty, their accuracy, time allocation, and error patterns begin to reveal
their understanding of the content. Cognitive indicators provide a window into whether the learner
is progressing steadily, struggling with specific concepts, or entering a state of cognitive overload.
c. Affective Capture
Affective signals introduce an additional dimension that is frequently missing in conventional
CBT systems. Facial expressions, gaze direction, and head movements can reveal emotional states
that influence learning effort. Signs such as confusion, frustration, or declining interest are
especially important in high stakes settings like JAMB preparation. By capturing these signals,
the system begins to approximate how a human tutor might perceive a student’s emotional state
during study.
3. Processing Layer
Once the raw data is collected, each category undergoes a form of structured interpretation.
a. Behavioural Processing Layer
This layer organises the interaction logs into meaningful behavioural profiles. Instead of
recording isolated actions, the processing layer identifies trends and patterns. For instance, a
learner who consistently spends too little time on difficult questions might be rushing, while one
who requests multiple hints may be seeking additional support.
7b. Cognitive Analysis Engine
The cognitive engine interprets performance trajectories. It evaluates whether the learner is
improving, plateauing, or declining as they progress. It also identifies the types of errors being
made, which may indicate misconceptions rather than simple mistakes. This interpretation helps
determine when the system should introduce additional scaffolding or adjust question difficulty.
c. Affective Analysis Unit
This unit applies affective modelling techniques to the visual data. It estimates the learner’s
emotional state using facial cues or gaze stability. Although interpretations are probabilistic, when
combined with behavioural and cognitive indicators they provide a clearer understanding of the
learner’s engagement.
4. Engagement Fusion Layer
This layer plays a pivotal role by bringing together the outputs from all three processing units.
Instead of treating behavioural, cognitive, and affective cues separately, the fusion layer integrates
them into a unified engagement state.
The purpose of this fusion is to:
• reduce noise produced by relying on a single data source
• improve reliability through corroboration across modalities
• provide a coherent representation of real-time engagement
A student who appears to be performing well but shows clear signs of emotional fatigue, for
example, may still benefit from adaptive intervention.
5. Reinforcement Learning Agent
At this stage, the system moves from observation to decision making. The reinforcement learning
agent receives the fused engagement state and evaluates the possible instructional actions
available. Its objective is to choose the action that will most likely improve engagement and
support learning progression.
The RL agent gradually learns from previous decisions. Over time it refines its strategy,
developing a policy that aligns interventions with patterns that have historically improved learner
engagement and performance.
6. Adaptive Instructional Decision Module
This module converts the RL agent’s selected action into an instructional response. The system
may, for instance:
• increase or reduce question difficulty
• break a complex problem into structured steps
8• provide a targeted hint
• prompt the learner to regain focus
• introduce a brief pause to reduce cognitive strain
This stage ensures that instructional support is timely and sensitive to the learner’s immediate
state.
7. Updated CBT Learning Environment
After the chosen adaptation is applied, the learning interface updates accordingly. The learner
experiences a changed environment—one that reflects the system’s interpretation of their
engagement. This environment may appear only subtly different, but these small adjustments
accumulate to shape a more personalised learning trajectory.
8. Feedback Loop to Student
The architecture ends where it began: with the learner. Each adaptation alters the learner’s
behaviour, performance, and emotional state in some way. These new signals are again captured,
processed, fused, and fed into the RL agent.
This recurring cycle gives the system its adaptive character. The system is not static; it continually
evolves in response to the learner’s ongoing engagement.
Overall Significance
The architecture demonstrates how modern AI techniques allow a digital system to approximate
the insight of a human tutor by observing multiple layers of engagement. It provides a structured
pathway for capturing detailed learning signals, interpreting them, and transforming them into
adaptive support that evolves over time.
9Conceptual Framework Diagram
Explanation of the Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework illustrates the theoretical and operational relationships among the key
variables involved in developing an adaptive intelligent tutoring system for CBT preparation. It
shows how engagement signals flow from the learner, how they are interpreted by the system,
and how instructional adaptation influences learning outcomes.
The diagram is organised into four major elements:
(1) the learner, (2) engagement based indicators, (3) the adaptive intelligent tutoring system,
and (4) instructional adaptation leading to outcomes.
Each element is connected by directional arrows to show the logical progression from observation
to adaptation and eventual learning improvement.
1. Learner
The framework begins with the learner, who is the central participant in the CBT preparation
environment. The learner brings cognitive abilities, prior knowledge, affective tendencies, and
behavioural habits into the study session. These natural attributes influence how the learner
interacts with the system.
The framework positions the learner at the top because all observable indicators originate from
this point. Without learner interaction, no adaptive mechanism can be triggered.
102. Engagement Based Indicators
The learner's interactions generate measurable signals known as engagement based indicators.
These indicators are grouped into three categories:
a. Behavioural Indicators
These reflect observable actions such as response time, task persistence, navigation patterns, and
interaction frequency. They reveal how actively the learner is participating.
b. Cognitive Indicators
These relate to performance outcomes, accuracy levels, difficulty progression, and error patterns.
They indicate how well the learner is processing and understanding the material.
c. Affective Indicators
These include emotional cues such as facial expressions, gaze stability, frustration levels, or signs
of fatigue. They help identify shifts in emotional engagement.
The framework treats these indicators as mediating variables that link learner activity to the
adaptive capacity of the system. In other words, without engagement cues, the system cannot
determine when or how to intervene.
3. Adaptive Intelligent Tutoring System
This is the core component of the framework. It represents the computational processes that
interpret the engagement indicators and transform them into actionable instructional decisions.
The system performs four essential functions:
a. Capture
It receives behavioural, cognitive, and affective signals from the learner.
b. Interpretation
It processes and analyses these signals to determine the learner’s engagement state.
c. Integration
It fuses the different categories of indicators into a more reliable representation of the learner’s
condition.
d. Adaptation
It selects and delivers appropriate feedback or instructional support.
This system acts as the mechanism through which engagement signals influence the learning
environment.
114. Instructional Adaptation
Instructional adaptation refers to the specific changes the system makes in response to the
learner’s engagement state. Examples include:
• adjusting the difficulty of questions
• offering hints or scaffolding
• providing motivational or corrective feedback
• encouraging the learner to refocus
• changing the mode of presentation
• pacing the learner’s activity
The conceptual framework positions instructional adaptation as the immediate output of the
intelligent tutoring system. It is the visible way the system responds to the learner’s engagement.
5. Learning Outcomes
At the bottom of the framework are the expected learning outcomes. These outcomes represent
the improvement the system aims to achieve through continuous adaptation. Key outcomes may
include:
• enhanced engagement
• greater persistence
• improved accuracy and mastery
• reduced frustration
• better overall performance in CBT preparation
Learning outcomes close the cycle by showing the ultimate effect of the intelligent tutoring
system on the learner.
How the Framework Operates as a Whole
The conceptual framework demonstrates a linear but cyclical logic:
Learner → Engagement Indicators → Intelligent Tutoring System → Instructional
Adaptation → Learning Outcomes
• The learner produces engagement signals.
• The system uses these signals to interpret the learner’s needs.
• Adaptation is delivered based on that interpretation.
• The learner responds to the adaptation, producing new engagement signals.
• The cycle repeats throughout the learning session.
This continuous loop is fundamental to adaptive learning systems and illustrates how technology
can approximate the responsive behaviour of a human tutor.
